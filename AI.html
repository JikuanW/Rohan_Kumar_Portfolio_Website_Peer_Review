            <p>
                This page contains AI-generated content used for creative
                reflection and exploration. Since I am passionate about soccer,
                I asked the AI to see which national soccer team fits me the best.

            <h2>AI-Generated Soccer Identity</h2>

            <p>
                Germany fits me because of its emphasis on discipline, preparation,
                and collective responsibility. The German national team values
                structure, consistency, and execution under pressure rather than
                relying on individual brilliance.
            </p>

            <p>
                Within Germany’s history, the 2014 World Cup–winning squad represents
                this mindset most clearly. That team succeeded through tactical
                intelligence, adaptability, and trust in the system, with every
                player understanding their role and contributing to the collective
                goal.
