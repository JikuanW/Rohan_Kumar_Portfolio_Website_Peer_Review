## Generative AI Usage Statement

Generative AI tools were used **selectively and transparently** during the development of this project. All AI-assisted output was **reviewed, edited, and understood** by me before inclusion.

### Primary AI Tool Used

* **ChatGPT (OpenAI)**

### AI Usage by Area

#### AI Reflection Page (`AI.html`)

ChatGPT was used to assist with the **written reflective content** on the AI page. The tool helped articulate ideas related to creativity, personal interests, and identity in the context of AI-assisted exploration.

Example prompts included:

* *“Help me write a reflective section about how AI can be used for creative exploration.”*
* *“Rewrite this paragraph to sound clearer and more thoughtful.”*

The final content reflects my own perspective and was edited to align with course expectations.

---

#### HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Support

ChatGPT was also used occasionally as a **development aid** to:

* Clarify semantic HTML structure
* Debug JavaScript event-handling logic
* Explain JS structure. 
* Refine CSS layout behavior (e.g., image sizing and responsiveness)

Example prompts included:

* *“Why is my image appearing vertically stretched in CSS?”*
* *“Why is my button click handler not working as expected?”*
*  * *“How does JS work with links and how can i connect it”*
